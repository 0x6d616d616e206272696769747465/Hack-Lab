## Week 2 Lab

For this week's lab, we're going to be connecting to our raspberry pi using the following command:

For Mac/linux
1.  Open Terminal
1.  When you see the dialog prompt appear, type in the following:
  * ```\#>ssh <username>@<hostname>```

e.g. ```#>ssh root@furiosa```

root = our username
furiosa = our hostname

Now that we have a shell on our remote machine, we can start playing with some linux commands
