* Backup your work!!! If you write something you can’t replace, make SURE that you scp the files back to your machine, or backup with some other method. If you have questions about this, please make sure to ask me. 
* Play Nice - This is a place of learning for all of us. If you get access to a classmate’s environment, be kind and don’t delete or move their stuff.
Build Rapport
If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let your instructor know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing your instructor when difficulties arise during the semester so that we can help you find a solution.
