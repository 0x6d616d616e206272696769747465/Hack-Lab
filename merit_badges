#Merit Badges

Each student enrolled in Hack Lab 2018 will be eligible to earn merit badges.

Most merit badges can only be earned by a single student who successfully reaches the qualifying criteria first.

The criteria for some merit badges will be published, others will not be. Hexadecim8 reserves the right to add more badges to the class as the year goes on, new badges will be updated on this list, so don't forget to check the list!
